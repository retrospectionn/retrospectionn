ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @retrospectionn

Currently learning on how to get machine learning algo's to conform with South Asian style housing so I can lazily map and add houses on OpenStreetMaps.
Interested in learning R and Rust.

Rust for me is like an F-35. An overpowered machine but rarely used.

R is the cool third child and blazes through everything and that everyone loves.

Feel free to drop me a message if you're willing to collaborate. I'll update this readme as I progress my learning path.
